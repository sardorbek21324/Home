# Home Bot ‚Äî Domestic Task Manager for Telegram

A household management bot built with **aiogram 3**, **SQLAlchemy 2**, and **APScheduler 3**. The bot runs daily task races, photo verification with voting, score tracking, and admin tools that match the specification provided in the project brief.

## Key Features
- üîî Daily and weekly task generation at 04:00 (local time) with quiet-hour awareness.
- üßπ Task race with "take now" and up to two 30‚Äëminute deferrals (‚àí20%/‚àí40% reward).
- üì∏ Photo reports routed to peers for voting (auto-finalisation after 15 minutes if only one vote).
- üìâ Automatic penalties when nobody claims a task by the template deadline or when SLA is missed.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Re-announcements every ~2 hours until a task is taken, observing quiet hours.
- üßæ Score ledger with `/balance`, `/history`, `/rating`, and monthly reset flow.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Dispute tracking with `/disputes` and `/resolve_dispute` admin actions.
- ü§ñ AI-–∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–ª–µ—Ä, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –∫–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–∫—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Ç –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á.
- üõ† Admin commands for manual announcements, template seeding, dispute resolution, and season resets.

## Environment & Configuration
- Python 3.11 is required. The repository ships with `.python-version` and `runtime.txt` to keep Koyeb and local tooling aligned.
- Default database: `sqlite:///data.db` stored in the working directory. Override with `DATABASE_URL` (e.g. PostgreSQL) if needed.
- Quiet hours and timezone are configurable; announcements are deferred to the first available slot outside quiet hours.
- `ADMIN_IDS` accepts a single int, CSV string, or JSON list ‚Äî parsing is handled in `home_bot/config.py`.

### Required environment variables
| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token. The bot refuses to start if empty. |
| `ADMIN_IDS` | Admin Telegram user IDs (int / CSV / JSON). |
| `TZ` | IANA timezone (default `Europe/Warsaw`). |
| `QUIET_HOURS` | Quiet window like `23:00-08:00`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional; defaults to `sqlite:///data.db`. |

Additional optional variable: `TZ` defaults to `Europe/Warsaw`, matching the specification.

## Commands & Menus

```

### Admin commands
- `/announce` ‚Äî force re-announce the oldest open task.
- `/add_task code;Title;points;frequency;max_per_day;sla;claim_timeout;kind;penalty` ‚Äî add a template.
- `/disputes` ‚Äî list unresolved disputes.
- `/resolve_dispute <id> <approve|reject> <note>` ‚Äî close a dispute and optionally grant reward.
- `/ai_stats` ‚Äî show adaptive reward coefficients per user.
- `/ai_config penalty=0.05 bonus=0.02` ‚Äî tweak AI reward parameters.
- `/end_month` ‚Äî announce winner and reset seasonal scores.

## Behaviour Overview
1. **Task generation** ‚Äî 04:00 job creates instances for the day/week based on template frequency, then broadcasts announcements with inline buttons (take now/defer).
2. **Claim timeout** ‚Äî if nobody claims before `claim_timeout_minutes`, everyone receives the template penalty and the bot schedules a re-announcement after ~2 hours. This loop repeats until the task is taken.
3. **Deferrals & SLA** ‚Äî deferring adds 30 minutes per click (max twice) and reduces reward by 20%/40%. Missing the SLA results in an immediate double penalty and the task reopens.
4. **Reports & voting** ‚Äî performers send a photo; the bot forwards it to two peers for `/vote` buttons. Two votes end the review immediately; otherwise a 15-minute timer finalises with the first vote.
5. **Score ledger** ‚Äî every award or penalty creates a `ScoreEvent` entry. `/history` shows the last 20 records; `/rating` sorts by current balance.
6. **Disputes** ‚Äî negative or conflicting votes open a `Dispute` entry for admins. Resolutions are logged and, if approved, points are added retroactively.
7. **Quiet hours** ‚Äî any scheduled announcement that falls within quiet hours is delayed to the first allowed minute outside the window.

## Local Development
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make run   # or python -m home_bot.main
```

The `Makefile` includes a `run` target for convenience. Database tables and default templates are auto-created on startup.

## Deployment on Koyeb
1. Ensure the repository contains `Procfile` with `worker: python -m home_bot.main` (already provided).
2. In the Koyeb service:
   - Leave the Build command empty (Buildpack takes care of deps).
   - Set Run command to `python -m home_bot.main` or rely on the Procfile.
   - Configure environment variables as described above.
3. SQLite is stored in the working directory; for production use, supply a managed Postgres connection string via `DATABASE_URL`.

## AI Reward Controller
The adaptive reward engine lives in `home_bot/services/ai_controller.py`. It analyses how many tasks each family member –∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–∏–ª –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏–ª –∏ –≤—ã—á–∏—Å–ª—è–µ—Ç –∫–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç –≤–æ–∑–Ω–∞–≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ü—Ä–∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á –±–∞–∑–∞ (`base_points`) —É–º–Ω–æ–∂–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –∫–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç, –∞ —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ `effective_points`. –ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã `/ai_stats` –∏ `/ai_config` –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è—é—Ç –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é –∏ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã (`penalty_step`, `bonus_step`, –º–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π/–º–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ—ç—Ñ—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ —É–º–æ–ª—á–∞–Ω–∏—é).
